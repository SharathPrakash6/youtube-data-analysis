Context and Content:       
 In a fairly recent move by Youtube, it  announced the decision to hide the
 number of dislikes from users around November 2021. However, the official YouTube Data API allowed you to
 get information about dislikes until December 13, 2021. Doing an EDA-exercise can help to draw some unseen
 insights from this dataset.<br />
Objective:<br />
 To do data analysis and explore the youtube dislikes dataset using numpy and pandas libraries and drive
 meaningful insights by performing Exploratory data analysis.<br />
 Data Description:<br />
YouTube Dislikes Dataset:<br />
 ● This dataset contains information about trending YouTube videos from August 2020 to December 2021
 for the USA, Canada, and Great Britain.<br />
 ● This dataset contains the latest possible information about dislikes,likes,views and more which was
 collected just before December 13. The information was collected by videos that had been trending in
 the USA, Canada, and Great Britain for a year prior.<br />
Conclusion:-<br />
 The EDA provided valuable insights into the dynamics of dislikes on YouTube videos before the data became inaccessible. You discovered that certain video 
 categories, such as news and controversial topics, had higher dislike ratios compared to entertainment or educational content. The analysis also revealed that 
 videos with a higher number of views tend to have both more likes and dislikes, suggesting that engagement drives both positive and negative feedback. Your 
 findings offered a clearer picture of audience behavior and content reception, which could be useful for content creators and marketers on the platform.
